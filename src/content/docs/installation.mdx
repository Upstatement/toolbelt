<Aside type="caution">

Toolbelt is still in alpha. The API is subject to change.

</Aside>

There are two ways to install Toolbelt. In either case, it might be helpful to read through how [installation works for Alpine core](https://alpinejs.dev/essentials/installation). The following guide skips some details that are already covered in Alpine's documentation.

## From a script tag

The easiest way to install Toolbelt is to include its CDN link. Because Toobelt is an Alpine plugin, you will have to include Alpine as a dependency. In addition, the [Focus](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/focus) plugin is a required dependency for Toolbelt. **Notice that Toolbelt and Alpine plugins come _before_ Alpine core.**

<Steps>

1. Include the following script tags in your `<head>`:

   ```html
   <head>
     <!-- Toolbelt -->
     <script
       src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@upstatement/toolbelt@1.0.0-alpha/dist/plugin.cdn.js"
       defer
     ></script>

     <!-- Focus plugin (Toolbelt dependency) -->
     <script
       src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alpinejs/focus@3.14.7/dist/cdn.min.js"
       defer
     ></script>

     <!-- Alpine core -->
     <script
       src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.14.7/dist/cdn.min.js"
       defer
     ></script>
   </head>
   ```

2. You can now use Toolbelt components in your markup. **Make sure to read through [Using the Components](/using-the-components) before proceeding.**

</Steps>

<Aside title="Hardcoding Versions" type="tip">

The CDN links above hardcode the latest versions of each package. For stability in production, it's recommended to continue this practice.

</Aside>

## As a module

If you prefer bundling Toolbelt and its dependencies in your own Javascript bundle, you can install these packages via from the npm registry.

<Steps>

1. Install the following packages:

   ```bash
   npm install alpinejs @alpinejs/focus @upstatement/toolbelt
   ```

2. Import and initialize the packages like so:

   ```js
   import Alpine from "alpinejs";
   import focus from "@alpinejs/focus";
   import toolbelt from "@upstatement/toolbelt";

   window.Alpine = Alpine;

   Alpine.plugin(toolbelt);
   Alpine.plugin(focus);

   Alpine.start();
   ```

3. You can now use Toolbelt components in your markup. **Make sure to read through [Using the Components](/using-the-components) before proceeding.**

</Steps>
