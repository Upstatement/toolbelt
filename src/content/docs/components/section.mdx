<Toolbelt />

The `x-section` directive relates a `<section>` to its title for better screen reader navigation.

## Usage

<Anatomy>
  ```html
  <section x-init x-section>
    <h2 x-section:title>This is a section title</h2>
  </section>
  ```
</Anatomy>

## Demo

<Card>
  <section x-init="" x-section="">
    <h2 x-section:title="">This is a section title</h2>
  </section>
</Card>

Inspect the section title above. Notice that an `id` is automatically created for the `<h2>` and associated with the `<section>` with `aria-labelledby`.

```html ins='aria-labelledby="toolbelt-section-title-1"' ins='id="toolbelt-section-title-1"'
<section x-section aria-labelledby="toolbelt-section-title-1">
  <h2 x-section:title id="toolbelt-section-title-1">This is a section title</h2>
</section>
```
